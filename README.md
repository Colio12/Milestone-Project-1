# Milestone-Project-1
I used a tutorial to make this Trivia game. I've always loved trivia and thought a simple trivia game would be fun to make.
After I completed the tutorial I tried to make a 50/50 button that would delete two of the answers and leave the player with 2 of 4 choices to help them answer correctly.
I struggled with it so ended up deleting the 50/50 button. I have been struggling with javascript when it comes from scratch.
You play by answering the right questions to get a a score out of 10 and can replay the game if you want.
